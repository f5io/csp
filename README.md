# @paybase/csp

A library for Communicating Sequential Processes in Node.js, built on top of `async/await`.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40paybase%2Fcsp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40paybase%2Fcsp)

## Installation

This library requires `async/await` support in your Node.js runtime, so ideally `node>=7.4`.

```
$ npm install --save @paybase/csp
```

or

```
$ yarn add @paybase/csp
```

## Example Usage

Below is a trivial example of usage, that plays on the standard ping-pong example.

```javascript
const { channel, put, take } = require('@paybase/csp');

const timeout = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

const wiff = channel();
const waff = channel();

const createBall = () => ({ hits: 0, status: '' });

const createBat = async (inbound, outbound) => {
  while (true) {
    const ball = await take(inbound); // wait for an incoming ball
    ball.hits++;
    ball.status = ball.status === 'wiff!' ? 'waff!' : 'wiff!';
    console.log(`ðŸŽ¾  Ball hit ${ball.hits} time(s), ${ball.status}`);
    await timeout(500); // assume it's going to take a bit to hit the ball
    await put(outbound, ball); // smash the ball back
  }
};

createBat(waff, wiff); // create a bat that will wiff waffs
createBat(wiff, waff); // create a bat that will waff wiffs

put(waff, createBall());
```

## API

This library exposes 5 functions and one factory.

### `channel()`

This factory method constructs a new `channel` and returns it. A channel contains no publicly accessible properties, but contains information about interactions with the `channel`.

```javascript
const chan = channel();
```

### `put(channel, message)` -> `Promise`

The `put` function requires the `channel` on which to put the supplied `message`. The `put` method returns a `Promise` which can be optionally awaited and will resolve when something is ready to take the `message` from the `channel`.

```javascript
const chan = channel();
put(chan, 42);

// ...or...

await put(chan, 42);
```

### `take(channel)` -> `Promise`

The `take` function requires the `channel` to take from. The `take` method returns a `Promise` which should always be awaited and will resolve with a message, when a message is available.

```javascript
const chan = channel();

put(chan, 42);

const msg = await take(chan); // will receive 42
```

### `alts(...channels)` -> `Promise`

The `alts` function will race taking values from multiple `channels`.

```javascript
const chan1 = channel();
const chan2 = channel();

put(chan2, 42);
const msg = await alts(chan1, chan2); // will receive 42
```

### `select(Map<*, channel>|Set<channel>|Array<channel>|Object<string, channel>)` -> `Promise`

The `select` function will race taking values from multiple `channels`, similar to `alts`, but will also return the key of the channel that was selected.

```javascript
const chan1 = channel();
const chan2 = channel();

put(chan2, 42);
const channels = [chan1, chan2];
const result = await select(channels); // will receive [1, 42]
```

Works with `Map` and `Set` as well as with plain-old javascript arrays and objects.

### `drain(channel)` -> `Promise`

The `drain` function requires a `channel` which it will drain all messages from until empty, returning an array of messages.

```javascript
const chan = channel();
put(chan, 42);
put(chan, 41);
put(chan, 40);
put(chan, 39);

const msgs = await drain(chan); // will receive [ 42, 41, 40, 39 ]
```

## Async Iteration Protocol
Channels implement the async iterable interface, so you can transform the following example code:

```javascript
async function process (inbound, outbound) => {
  while (true) {
    const msg = await take(inbound);
    // do stuff with msg
    await put(outbound, res);
  }
};
```

into a cleaner version, thanks to the powerful `for-await-of`:

```javascript
async function process (inbound, outbound) => {
  for await(const msg of inbound) {
    // do stuff with msg
    await put(outbound, res);
  }
};
```
