# @jfet/csp

A library for Communicating Sequential Processes, built on top of `async/await` and the asynchronous iterable interface.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40jfet%2Fcsp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40jfet%2Fcsp)

## Installation

This library requires `async/await` and `for-await-of` support.

```
$ npm install --save @jfet/csp
```


## Example Usage

Below is a trivial example of usage, that plays on the standard ping-pong example.

```javascript
const { Channel } = require('@jfet/csp');

const timeout = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

const wiff = new Channel();
const waff = new Channel();

const createBall = () => ({ hits: 0, status: '' });

const createBat = async (inbound, outbound) => {
  while (true) {
    const ball = await inbound.take(); // wait for an incoming ball
    ball.hits++;
    ball.status = ball.status === 'wiff!' ? 'waff!' : 'wiff!';
    console.log(`ðŸŽ¾  Ball hit ${ball.hits} time(s), ${ball.status}`);
    await timeout(500); // assume it's going to take a bit to hit the ball
    await outbound.put(ball); // smash the ball back
  }
};

createBat(waff, wiff); // create a bat that will wiff waffs
createBat(wiff, waff); // create a bat that will waff wiffs

waff.put(createBall());
```

## API


### `Channel()`

This constructor constructs a new `channel` and returns it. A channel exposes some methods to interact with it.

```javascript
const chan = new Channel();
```

### `channel.put(message)` -> `Promise`

The `put` method takes a `message` and put it into the channel on which it was called. The `put` method returns a `Promise` which can be optionally awaited and will resolve when something is ready to take the `message` from the `channel`.

```javascript
const chan = new Channel();
chan.put(42);

// ...or...

await chan.put(42);
```

### `channel.take()` -> `Promise`

The `take` method requires no arguments. The `take` method returns a `Promise` which should always be awaited and will resolve with a message, when a message is available.

```javascript
const chan = new Channel();
chan.put(42);

const msg = await chan.take(); // will receive 42
```

### `Channel.alts(...channels)` -> `Promise`

The `alts` static method will race taking values from multiple `channels`.

```javascript
const chan1 = new Channel();
const chan2 = new Channel();

chan2.put(42);
const msg = await Channel.alts(chan1, chan2); // will receive 42
```

### `Channel.select(Map<*, channel>|Set<channel>|Array<channel>|Object<string, channel>)` -> `Promise`

The `select` static method will race taking values from multiple `channels`, similar to `alts`, but will also return the key of the channel that was selected.

```javascript
const chan1 = new Channel();
const chan2 = new Channel();

chan2.put(42);
const channels = [chan1, chan2];
const result = await Channel.select(channels); // will receive [1, 42]
```

Works with `Map` and `Set` as well as with plain-old javascript arrays and objects.

### `Channel.drain(channel)` -> `Promise`

The `drain` static method requires a `channel` which it will drain all messages from until empty, returning an array of messages.

```javascript
const chan = new Channel();
chan.put(42);
chan.put(41);
chan.put(40);
chan.put(39);

const msgs = await Channel.drain(chan); // will receive [ 42, 41, 40, 39 ]
```

## Async Iteration Protocol
Channels implement the async iterable interface, so you can transform the following illustrative code:

```javascript
async function process (inbound, outbound) => {
  while (true) {
    const msg = await inbound.take();
    // do stuff with msg
    await outbound.put(res);
  }
};
```

into a cleaner version, thanks to the powerful `for-await-of`:

```javascript
async function process (inbound, outbound) => {
  for await(const msg of inbound) {
    // do stuff with msg
    await outbound.put(res);
  }
};
```
